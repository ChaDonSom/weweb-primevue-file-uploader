## Requirements

OH! I see now...okay. I see why you were asking about displaying the image...for some reason I thought we got the original uploadcare uploader to work.

I don't see a difference in either of the images...but it could just be me.

https://uploadcare.com/docs/transformations/image/#:~:text=With%20Uploadcare%2C%20you%20can%20easily,that'll%20unify%20their%20look.

Your list is a good start:

- scale_crop with smart (they can enter the dimensions)
- rotate
- watermark (they can enter another UUID)
- format
- quality
- profile picture preset
- preview (on everything - I will need to research this more and also ask what you mean ðŸ˜…)

I'm adding:

- grayscale
- smart resize
- overlay (text and image only)
- blur
